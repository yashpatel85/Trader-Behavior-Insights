ðŸ“‚ Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between trader behavior (profitability, trade volume, direction) and market sentiment (Fear vs Greed).
The analysis combines two datasets:

Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index

The objective is to uncover how trading decisions align (or diverge) from overall market sentiment, and to identify signals for smarter trading strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Setup Instructions

Open in Google Colab

Upload this folder to Google Drive.

Open notebook_1.ipynb in Colab.

Mount Google Drive in Colab

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')


Navigate to Project Folder

import os
base_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/ds_<your_name>"
os.chdir(base_path)


Install Dependencies (if needed)

!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn pypandoc

ðŸ”¹ Usage

Run all cells in notebook_1.ipynb.

Cleaned CSVs will be stored in csv_files/.

Visual outputs (charts/plots) will be saved in outputs/.

Final report (ds_report.pdf) will summarize insights.

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights (Preview)

Fear States â†’ More SELL trades, higher volume, lower profitability.

Greed States â†’ More BUY trades, lower volume, higher profitability.

High Volume in Fear â†’ Panic-driven market moves.

Potential for contrarian strategies: buy during Fear, sell during Greed.
